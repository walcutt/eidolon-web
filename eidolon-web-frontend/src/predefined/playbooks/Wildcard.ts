    'The Wildcard is, well, a lot like its name implies. Their Starting Moves semi-randomly assign an Active Playbook to them, which transforms their Eidolon and allows them to use any Move they want in that Playbook. Since they theoretically have access to *any Move in the entire game*, The Wildcard has fewer Playbook Moves than normal. This is a class for players that want to try a little bit of everything, and who enjoy improvising around random circumstances.\n\n_Note: we do not recommend using this Playbook if you\'re new to EIDOLON, or to RPGs in general. The Wildcard requires a deep familiarity with all other Playbooks in order to play without significantly slowing down the pace of the game._\n\nAlso, keep in mind that you don\'t have to use the same Eidolon Power for each Playbook every time. When you change Playbooks, you can introduce a brand new power, even if you\'ve used that Playbook before. For the sake of maintaining the pace of the game, it\'s a good idea to have at least one Eidolon Power for each Playbook planned out in advance, but feel free to improvise when it feels right.One final thing: The Inhuman and The Beast are Playbooks that lean a lot more heavily on the Eidolon Master\'s attributes and abilities, rather than their Eidolon\'s. It might seem odd for your character to transform into a Shade or an animal. Decide at character creation if you\'d like to exclude these Playbooks from the pool you draw your Active Playbook from, or if you\'re good with some of the stranger effects Dealing In might have. The Veteran and The Wildcard are always excluded from the pool, because the way their Eidolon Powers work doesn\'t play well with Deal In.',
