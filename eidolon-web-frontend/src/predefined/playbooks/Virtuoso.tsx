        <p>The Virtuoso is a somewhat odd Playbook. A Virtuoso Eidolon doesn't behave like any other kind; instead of being an ethereal spirit that represents the soul of its master, it's an inanimate object that its master has to wield in order for it to do anything. Even if other Eidolons are invisible to those with <strong>sealed</strong> Eidolons, a Virtuoso Eidolon is visible and tangible. It just... seems like an ordinary object.</p>
        <p>Even so, it is alive, and still channels the spirit of its master to do incredible things. Because a Virtuoso Eidolon can be <em>literally any physical object</em>, the Playbook is really versatile, and the role you serve in your story depends heavily on the form your Eidolon takes. This is a Playbook for players that want to play as experts with impossible levels of skill, whose craft is fundamental to who they are.</p>
