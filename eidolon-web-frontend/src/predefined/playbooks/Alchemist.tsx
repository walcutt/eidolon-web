    <p>You deeply understand that everything is connected, and that the categories people divide the world into are ultimately arbitrary.

    <p>The Alchemist has one of the most versatile Eidolon Powers in the game, and most of the Playbook's Moves are dedicated to letting you make full use of that versatility. It's especially important to keep in mind though that when you have a power this open-ended, you need to limit yourself somewhat. "My Eidolon can transform any <strong>thing</strong> it touches into <strong>anything else</strong>" is technically a valid Eidolon Power for The Alchemist, but it's so broad that it's kind of overpowered, which arguably breaks the "good faith" rule. The Playbook will generally be a lot more fun if you impose some restrictions on yourself when creating your Eidolon Power, though of course you're free to do whatever you'd like as long as the group you play with is cool with it. This Playbook is for players that want a more off-the-wall ability, who like solving problems by thinking outside the box and finding clever, unique solutions.</p>,
